Rolls Royce R2 Factory X Code First Girls: AI & ML Climate Change Competition (October 2022) 
I completed a series of qualifying  coding courses encompassing: JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Python & App development as well as an introduction into AI & Machine Learning.


  • After 3-6 months of coding I formed a team and participated in R2 Factory’s AI & ML competition challenging students to 
  create a ML model themed around climate change. Hence, I formulated a project plan and created a linear regression 
  model that trained on past data of aviation emissions and studied the correlation between air pollution and global warming. 
  • Illustrated this via a series of graphics and diagrams using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot and Python libraries.  
  • Applied a debugging process and evaluated the value of the model based on performance metrics.
