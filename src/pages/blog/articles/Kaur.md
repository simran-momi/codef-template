Momis Muse, Founder (2021-2022)
A self made blog project that aimed to create an open discussion on mental health within the academic and career space. I curated an independent project that posted a monthly blog post based on personal experiences and difficulties of anonymous writers. The aim was to create relatable content as well as a cathartic means for those struggling to have an outlet for their problems. This later transpired into the COABK (Confessions of a Brown Kid) project, which provided a platform to anonymous writers to explain their nuanced experiences of growing up in a South Asian household, therefore normalising and openly discussing the culture of ethnic minorities. This was my first attempt at creating and leading a digital project.
