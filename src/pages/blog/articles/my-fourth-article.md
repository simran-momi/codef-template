title: Bubble Duck Soap Ltd | Raising Over £5000 for Charity
date: 07 June 2024
---
Bubble Duck Soap, Director (October 2022- Present)
Launched an online business selling hand-crafted  soaps and bath products, run via platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

  • Demonstrated entrepreneurship and business acumen as I chaired tasks such as registering the business, buying stock, 
   creating a marketing/advertising campaign and closed sales. 
  • Established a social media presence of 100 followers in 1 week by controlling the company’s social media presence.
  • Raised over £5000 through a charity auction event after noticing a consumer gap between my local community and small 
   businesses, thus displaying skills of proactivity and initiative. 
  • Have sold bulk orders over £250 to over 5 companies for corporate events, hence successfully establishing a brand image 
   and reputation that has reached beyond individual buyers.
